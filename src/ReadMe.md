# Marks Bank Ledger
This is a conceptual program of a console-based access point for a fake bank. The program design takes a user's email as their account name, and uses a Yahoo SMtP server to send an email as a passwordless form of authentication. An in-memory SQLite database is utilized for storing Data, using Entity Framework as an ORM and implementing the repository pattern for database interaction.

Despite being a console app, the program uses something similiar to a Model-View-Controller architecture. The models are POCOs created by Entity Framework in a regular MVC application style. The AccountController class functions as a controller, containing the instantiations of the repository classes and the database connection, along with all of the methods and logic flow backing the menu navigation. LedgerInterface is the final major piece, and functions as a collection of views, each method containing a specific user-facing console output, as well as logic for reading and validating user input.
